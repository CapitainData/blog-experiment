I am very curious and always ready to work on challenging tasks. I really prefer deliberate practice and I am use to take part to competitions on Kaggle and Zindi.\nHere, I write articles on everything I learn. It’s a kind of log journal for me. I cover topics like data visualization, modelling, engineering and also share techniques I use in programming contests.\nPersonal\nIn the twenties, beninese and passionate of activities such as playing basket ball, jogging, reading and blogging, I am aiming to become a renaissance man, someone who is passionate about every arts and sciences, someone who keeps to have doubts about the answers to his questions.\nAcademic Background\n Even though my interest is in data science generally, I started off majoring in Economic Statistics as an undergraduate, and eventually obtained a certification in Data Science. During undergraduate school, I became interested in data science for practical reasons, eventually choosing it as a concentration. That turned out to be a good fit for me, and I’ve been exploring and analyzing data ever since. \nPresent\n Currently I am an Independent Data Scientist, and I provide analytical insights and programming expertise to enable customers from a different range of industries realize their objectives. \n Previously, I was a Data Analyst Intern for APG in Dakar, Senegal. Before that, I was a Statistician intern INSAE at the National Institute of Economic and Statistical Analysis in Benin. In both settings I provided analytical, visualization, programming, conceptual, and other support to company. \n\nI am passionate about doing quality work that answers the questions at hand. What drew me to the world of data science and keeps my interest is that it frees me to engage in whatever science I like, and provides a great many tools with which to discover more about the things we humans are most interested in. CV can be found here. Feel free to reach me if you got any questions.\n\n\nDOSSEH Ameck Guy-Max Désiré\n    Email me       GitHub      LinkedIn       Twitter \n\n\n\n\n",
